## Louvain stability optimisation

The C++ code performing the stability optimisation is based on the implementation of the Louvain method as available from http://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities (Authors: Jean-Loup Guillaume / Etienne Lefebvre)

The Louvain code was adapted and extended by Renaud Lambiotte (http://www.lambiotte.be) to allow for the optimisation of the stability quality function and was subsequently refined by Antoine Delmotte and Michael Schaub. Forked from https://github.com/michaelschaub/PartitionStability
